THIS IS RAW NPC DATA, instances of NPCs are generated with data from here so that each game can update the isComplete boolean.
OPTIONS are picked from random good and bad arrays? so that option[0] adds points and option[1] does nothing and option[2] deducts points

there can be npcs where there is no request?
