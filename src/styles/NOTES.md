### Dialog Boxes
Features of an Excellent Dialog Box
Have dialog box in/out transitions but keep them brief. Let the player read the text, that's the meat!
Spoken text should type into the box.
Support different type in speeds (to show a pause or consideration on behalf of the speaker).
Let the player cancel the text type in and jump to the fully displayed text.
Support symbols in the text.
Support colored text.
Have some way of indicating the speaker (portrait, title or speech bubble trail that comes from the speaker).
Use an indicator to show if there's more text to read.
Layout out the text ahead of time to stop words jumping from one line to the next due to word wrapping.
