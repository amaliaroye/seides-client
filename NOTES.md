### Components
Random Number Generator Hook?
: function that takes in two numbers as a range and returns a randomly generated number. Used to select dialogue to display

Event Listener
: Listens for keyboard inputs, changes state?

Event Handler
: Handles movement of player

The basic idea is to use setInterval() at some arbitrary delay that corresponds to a desired frame rate. After every interval an update function will repaint the canvas showing the current view.
