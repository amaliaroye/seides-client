# [Suggested Schedule](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/capstone-project/blob/main/schedule.md)

- Most importantly, remember to **go slowly and be methodical**. That means you should be testing your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code.
- Always be commiting. Deploy early and often.
- Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
- Design first. Planning with user stories and wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
- Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems.
- Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.
- Write your code DRY and build your APIs RESTful.
- Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- Keep user stories small and well-defined, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- Make it all well-formatted. Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
- Comment your code. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
